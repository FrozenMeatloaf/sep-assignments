#1: Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

7 iterations

#2: Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint,
how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

1, because "high" would be `G`?

#3: Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand

55, 89, 144

#1: Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.

I'd use a binary search with recursion because the process would be faster.  Iteration
linearly through millions of items would take a long amount of time.  Divide and conquering
with binary would half this time.  Introducing recursion would keep the algorithm down.

#2: Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
solution? Explain your reasoning

I would choose a binary search again since the item count is high.  Although recursion might not be
necessary, it still may prove quicker to use.  Would also use less lines of code.
